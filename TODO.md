- the client side editor needs configurability
  - switch modes on demand
  - switch keybindings
  - theme changing
  - position
  - split panels

- the client sends asset changes to the browser and
  the browser sends asset changes back to the server.

  however, pre-compiled asset changes are not reflected
  in the in-browser editor when the server changes them.

  not even sure how to get around this honestly.
